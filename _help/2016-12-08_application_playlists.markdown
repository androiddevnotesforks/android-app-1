## Playlists

Currently the playlists view is really simple. You can swipe to refresh
the playlists that are cached locally on your device and you can press
on a playlist in order to start playing all the tracks of the
said playlist.

{: .thumbnail }

> For version v1.x there are no plans to enhance the playlist functionality.

> However for v2.x you will be able to delete playlists from the device,
add tracks to existing playlists through the library browser, or create new playlists.
You will also be able view the tracks for each playlist and probably also remove
tracks from playlists.
