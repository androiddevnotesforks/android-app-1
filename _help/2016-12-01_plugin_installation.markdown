## Downloading

Before starting to use MusicBee Remote you first have to download the plugin on your PC.
You will require the latest release available if you installed the application from Play
Store.

The plugin can be found either on [GitHub](https://github.com/kelsos/mbrc-plugin/releases),
or at the MusicBee [Plugins](http://getmusicbee.com/addons/plugins/75/musicbee-remote-plugin) page.

There are two actual ways to install the plugin on your computer. The automated way through
the musicbee_remote*.exe installer and the manual installation by using the 7z archive.
7z is definitely the way to go if you are running the portable version of MusicBee.


## Installation

If you are doing the installation through the 7z archive,
the installation is pretty straightforward.
You just have to extract the archive's contents in the **Plugins** folder of MusicBee.
If you are running the portable version just locate your **MusicBee\Plugins** folder
and extract the contents. If you just want to use the archive on a regular installation you can
usually locate the Plugins folder under **C:\Program Files (x86)\MusicBee\Plugins**.

 If you downloaded the installer you can proceed with the installation.
 The installer is not digitally signed so if you have UAC enable you will
 get a warning about the application being published by an unknown publisher.
 Just make sure that the Plugin was downloaded from one of the two sources
 mentioned above and you should be safe.

Once you start the installation it can be completed in 5 simple steps as you can see below.
Just make sure that during the plugin installation MusicBee is not actually running.
