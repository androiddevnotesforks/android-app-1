## Installation

There are two ways to install the application. If you have access to
Google Play Store the application is available for direct download.

Search for "MusicBee Remote" and install like every other application.

Alternatively there are two apks available on the project [GitHub](https://github.com/kelsos/mbrc/releases) page.
The play release is the same version that is uploaded to the Play Store and uses
the Crashlytics SDK to track crashes, on the other hand the github
release is without Crashlytics and doesn't track any crashes.


In the second case you have to download the apk on your device and enable
the *installation of non-market apps* on your android device. A quick
google search will provide you with information on how to enable
the installation of non-market applications.
