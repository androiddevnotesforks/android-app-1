1. **Hamburger menu**: Opens the application navigation menu.

2. **Rating Star**: Opens the rating dialog that allows you rate the playing track.

3. **Love Icon**: Adds the track as a favorite or removes a track from favorites.
*If you have last.fm this will love the track on last.fm*

4. **Overflow menu**: Here you can find the last.fm enable checkbox that
 enables/disables scrobbling if you have provided your last.fm credentials
 to MusicBee. It also provides the share button that shares the playing
 track information to other applications installed on the device.

5. **Cover**: Displays the cover of the playing track if it is found,
or a placeholder image if not.

6. **Track Progress**: The first value represents the current position of the playing track.
The last represents the total duration of the track. The slider can move the playback position
to any point.

7. **Track Information**: In the first line you can see the **Title** of the playing
track, in the second you can see the **Artist**. The third line displays the **Album**
along with the **Year** if the year exists.

8. **Mute Button**: Mutes or unmutes the audio output.

9. **Volume Slider**: Controls the volume level.

10. **Controls**: The first one is **Repeat** which supports only **All** and **None**.
*(At some point repeat one was not supported by the MusicBee api, I have no idea if this has changed since)*.
Then you have **Previous**, **Play/Pause** and **Next**. If you long press
the **Play/Pause** it will stop the playback. Finally there is **Shuffle**
which supports **OFF**, **ON**, **AUTODJ**. When pressed it will switch to
the next status with the order specified above.
