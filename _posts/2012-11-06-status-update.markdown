Hello and sorry for the luck of updates, due to work taking a great
portion of my time everyday the progress on the Remote Development is a
little bit slower however I am already working on some new things for
the next update.

First of all the new version will have a reworked the now playing list
you can see a demonstration to the following video:

Also on the new version the playlist functionality will be more forgiving
to missing tags, and it will send more than 500 tracks.

I am also working on notification on the status similar to the one in
Apollo player of CyanogenMod.

After finishing with this version I will start working on the library
integration part so I would like you to send suggestions on how
would you like this feature to work. This along with a proper tablet
version will be probably the next features I will focus.

Feel free to <a href="mailto:kelsos@kelsos.net">e-mail</a> me with
suggestions or reply to the related [Topic](http://getmusicbee.com/forum/index.php?topic=7221.0)
on MusicBee forums.
