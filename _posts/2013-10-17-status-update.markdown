An update has been released that fixes a minor issue with the plugin, the issue would cause the plugin to stop accepting connections in some cases..v0.9.6 of the plugin is available, it fixes a minor issue that would cause MusicBee to crash.

Also the feature development of the Remote has resumed, I am currently working on the playlist support functionality.

Finally There is also an updated version of the Android application fixing an issue with the application crashing in the settings dialog for devices running Android 2.2.
