I am currently working on some layout fixes, I hope to get another test version out in the next days. This will be v0.9.6 of the remote application. After this there will be a test period of a few days. If no deal breaking issues - bugs are reported the version will be promoted to stable and will be deployed to Google Play to replace the existing v0.2.3.1 of the remote.

After the release of the new version the development will slow down due to a busy schedule (work, exams and I also have to finish preparing and present my thesis) till the end of September.

The features that are planned for the next release after this one, are the implementation of Playlist Management. And the addition of widgets.
