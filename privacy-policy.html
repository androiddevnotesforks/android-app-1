                <p class="text-justify">
                    The MusicBee plugin contacts the kelsos.net domain when the user checks for updates, there is no
                    data collection during the call, it is purely used as means to determine the latest version
                    available.
                </p>

                <p>From v1.0.0 the application also includes the <a
                        href="http://try.crashlytics.com/terms/privacy-policy.pdf">Crashlytics SDK</a>. </p>
                <p>For any concerned user, there is also a version build without the Crashlytics SDK available on the
                    GitHub
                    releases page of the project.</p>

                        call
                        as part of the
                        feature to perform action on an incoming call.

                        It can be safely disabled without affecting anything other than the (Pause/Stop/Reduce Volume)
